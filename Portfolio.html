    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to My Portfolio! Over my past few years as a Computer Program Developer, I have created tons of cool projects. 
      Here is a catalog of the best projects I've made. 
      Most projects have a Github link attached to them if you would like to check the project out for yourself!
    </p>

    <h2>PyWeek35</h2>
    <p>
      One of the Game Jams I compete in is the PyWeek Game Jam. This is a Bi-Annual Game Jam where you have one week to create a game using Python. 
      These are always really fun to participate in and be a part of. PyWeek34 was from March 25th to April 1st 2023. 
      I was teamed with <a href="https://baileyswebsite.ddns.net/Home" target="_blank">Bailey</a>, another Python Developer and good friend of mine. We created a really cool game called Echos in the Dark. 
      Here are a few pictures of the game. The Github project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RangerRhino23/PyWeek35" target="_blank">Here</a>.

    <h2>PyWeek34</h2>
    <p>
      One of the Game Jams I compete in is the PyWeek Game Jam. This is a Bi-Annual Game Jam where you have one week to create a game using Python. 
      These are always really fun to participate in and be a part of. PyWeek34 was from September 4th to September 11th 2022. 
      I was a solo developer and ended up not completing my game in time but I learned a lot about game development and had a great time. 
      The Github project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RangerRhino23/PyWeek34" target="_blank">Here</a>.

    <h2>Platformer Taptapir</h2>
    <p>
      Platformer Taptapir is a web based game where you have to jump on different blocks and moving platforms to reach the flag.
      This game is created using a Javascript Engine called Taptapir created by Pokepetter. It allows you to create web games using
      Python Syntax. The Taptapir website can be found <a href="https://pokepetter.github.io/taptapir/docs/index.html" target="_blank">Here</a>.
