        Hello! My name is Ryan Dahlke but many know me online as RangerRhino23. I am a Content Creator as well as a Computer Programming Developer.
        I enjoy programming in Python as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy participating in different Python Game Jams
        as well as working on different projects with other Python Developers. I also sometimes make Minecraft content with friends on youtube.
        Outside of my online life, I am involved in a few different groups including Boy Scouts, Order of the Arrow, and school sports. Here are a just
        a few pictures of different activities I participate in outside of programming and content creation.

        Although my programming carrer has just begun, I have done a bunch of different things involving programming. I started to learn about computer programming in
        the fall of 2021. In math class, there was a math problem involving a spinner and different colors the spinner could land on. The math teacher breifly said something
        about the problem but skipped over it cause it was a very complicated problem to solve. After class, I had asked him if a computer simulation could figure out the answer
        to the problem and he agreed that a simulation could solve it so he had me write a simulation to solve the problem. This introduced me into Python, a simple programming
        language, and since then, I have built countless projects using Python. <a href="portfolio" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to see my portfoilo
