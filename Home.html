    <!--ABOUT MYSELF-->
    <h2 id="about-myself">About Myself</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, My name is Ryan but I am also known online as RangerRhino23. I am a high school student in the United States. I enjoy computer programming,
      photography, and editing. I also enjoy running and playing in my schools orchestra. For computer programming, I mostly program in Python as well as some HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
      I have participated in a few different coding competitions before as well as worked with other programming developers to work on different projects. Outside of my
      online life, I am involved in a few different groups including Boy Scouts, Order of the Arrow, and a few school activities. Below are a few pictures from different
      activities I've done outside of programming.

        Although my programming carrer has just begun, I have done a bunch of different things involving programming. I started to learn about computer programming in
        the fall of 2021. In math class, there was a math problem involving a spinner and different colors the spinner could land on. The math teacher breifly said something
        about the problem but skipped over it cause it was a very complicated problem to solve. After class, I had asked him if a computer simulation could figure out the answer
        to the problem and he agreed that a simulation could solve it so he had me write a simulation to solve the problem. This introduced me into Python, a simple programming
        language, and since then, I have built countless projects using Python. <a href="portfolio" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to see my portfoilo
        filled with tons of the best projects I've created.
