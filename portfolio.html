        Welcome to My Portfolio! Over my past few years as a Computer Program Developer, I have created tons of cool projects.
        Here is a catalog of the best projects I've made. Most projects have a Github link attached to them if you would like
        to check the project out for yourself!

            One of the Game Jams I compete in is the PyWeek Game Jam. This is a Bi-Annual Game Jam where you have one week to
            create a game using Python. These are always really fun to participate in and be a part of. PyWeek34 was from 
            March 25th to April 1st 2023. I was teamed with another Python Developer named <a href="https://github.com/ItsbaileyX3525" target="_blank">ItsBailey</a>
            and we created a really cool game called Echos in the Dark. Here are a few pictures of the game. The Github project can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/RangerRhino23/PyWeek35" target="_blank">Here</a>.

            September 4th to September 11th 2022. I was a solo developer and ended up not completing my game in time but I learned
            a lot about game developement and had a great time. The Github project can be found
